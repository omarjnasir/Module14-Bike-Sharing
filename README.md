Overview
Kate and Kevin from Des Moines, Iowa visit New York City and are fascinated by the bike business and easy access to all the city points of interests. They rent bikes and roam the city. It is fun and a carefree way of knowing the city and its residents. During the trip back to Des Moines, Iowa they wondered, if this “Bike Business” can be produced in Des Moines, Iowa and if they could find some investors. Kate has an Angel Investor, who is interested in the project, but would like to know more. Other investors may also join. So, they create a Tableau Presentation for the Des Moines Investment Community, using New York City Bike Business as a model.
Results
 
This screen shot depicts Checkout times by gender. Most of the bikes were rented out by males (over 100,000) and about 30,000 by females. In marketing it is important to know your customer and their preferences, so that you can tailor the product to the demands of the marketplace. This presentation is for the investors, who seeing the market potential can invest.


 Fig 2: Most of the trips were made either in the morning between 6:00am to 9:00am or in the evening hours between 4:00pm to 7:00pm. This is understandable as most people work during  


Trips by Gender  shows that most trips were made by males during the same time mentioned above.
 
There are two types of customers-long term and short term. Long term customers are called subscribers and short term are referred as customers in this sheet. As you notice that there are more subscribers than short term customers, so the marketing plan would have to tilt towards subscribers.






 
Sometimes it is advantageous to present results all the together, so that the viewer can get a composite feel for the situation. This graph is called Dashboard. There are 3 graphs on the same page, so visual correlation is readily established.






 
This is the first graph representing time vs. count. It shows the minutes a bike is rented for.








 
In tableau, there 3 types of entries: work sheet, dashboard and story. Single graphs are represented by worksheets, while dashboard represent multiple graphs. The story graphs is the description of the project.

Summary
•	There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
•	For most part the presentation is convincing, however it is not the final product. To get investor money, one would need at least a “business plan” and a reasonable presentation in power point, with Excel and Tableau inserts. Investors want to know the return on investment and cash flow and breakeven point. So this is the first step.
•	Another aspect of investment is who is minding the store? Who is the management team. The qualifications and experience of the people in management have to be articulated and the management team generate confidence.
To sum it up MBAs are needed to pull this plan together. They can make the business plan and the cash flow diagrams, show the break- even point, and the Return on Investment.
